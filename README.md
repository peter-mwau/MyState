# MyState
It my first solidity guided program to write. It contains an array/list with three elements(Waiting, Ready,Active) and in which I initially set the state value to "Waiting" and in which it should return a similar state. But then I also define a activate function which when clicked assigns "Active" state to the state variable/object
