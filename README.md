# MyState
Its my first solidity guided program to write. It contains an array/list with three elements(Waiting, Ready,Active) and in which I initially set the state value to "Waiting" and in which it should return a similar state. But then I also define an activate function which when clicked assigns "Active" state to the state variable/object and returns true if the state is "active".
